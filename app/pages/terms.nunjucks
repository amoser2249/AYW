<h5>6. Our Services</h5>
<p>Please note that CutMyElectricBill.com&#8480; is not itself a provider of the energy industry products and services advertised on this Website (a “Service Provider”), and the information you provide to CutMyElectricBill.com&#8480; is not a formal application for the products and services offered by these Service Providers. CutMyElectricBill.com&#8480; works with a network of leading energy industry Service Providers, as well as in some cases third-party finder and lead aggregator companies who will pass along your information to energy industry Service Providers (“Service Providers’ Agents”), who participate in our matching engine and may have products or services available matching the criteria you submit through our forms to address your energy needs.</p>
<p>Our Website acts as a venue to allow Service Providers and Service Providers’ Agents in the energy industry, and other parties who are customers of our Websites, such as marketing partners, to offer for sale and sell, in a variety of formats, energy industry and other authorized products and services to potential consumers of legal age (each, a “Prospect”; all Prospects and Service Providers, and Service Provider Agents are referred to together as the Website’s “Users”) who have visited our Website and completed a form to obtain energy-related products or services or other authorized products or services (the “Service”) from Service Providers or Service Providers’ Agents.</p>
<p>We are not involved in the actual transaction between any Prospect and any Service Provider or Service Provider’s Agent even though we may, through our Website, and with each Prospect’s authorization, collect certain information (collectively, a “Lead”) about any Prospect and sell such Lead to Service Providers or those Service Providers’ Agents. As a result, the quality, safety or legality of the products offered by any Service Provider for sale, the truth or accuracy of the representations regarding such products, the ability of Service Providers to offer or sell such products or the ability of Prospects to pay for the products offered are solely the responsibility of each User, and we remain a separate and independent contractor for all purposes. Importantly, we do not ourselves offer any energy industry products or services.</p>
<p>We are not responsible in any way for the conduct of any Prospect, Service Provider, or Service Provider’s Agent, and we do not endorse or recommend any particular company, Service Provider, Service Provider’s Agent, or the products or services they offer or are otherwise associated with. Additionally, we do not provide insurance, tax, legal, financial, or any other formal advice. We do not guarantee that any of the Service Providers and Service Provider’s Agents to whom we forward any Prospect’s application will contact such Prospect or agree to provide the Prospect with the desired product or service. If you are a Prospect and you would like personal advice or specific recommendations regarding energy industry products or services, please consult with an expert or other qualified professional in that industry.</p>
<p>The Service Providers that can provide you with energy industry products or services may not respond with offers until they obtain additional information from you, and you may not be matched with the Service Provider or Service Provider’s Agent making any specific quote or offer.  Although Leadnomics is compensated by its network of Service Providers and Service Provider’s Agents when we display advertisements for their products and services to you and/or when you respond to a quote or offer for products or services from our network of Service Providers and Service Provider’s Agents, Leadnomics does not make any decisions in connection with the offering of any product or service.

Service Providers and Service Providers’ Agents may discontinue, suspend or terminate the offering of any product or service in any specific state at any time, without prior notice.</p>
<p>The data and other information you may provide Leadnomics through this Website is not, and is not treated as, an application for any energy industry product or service, nor as a request to be pre-approved, pre-qualified or any similar concept, for such products or services. Completing our forms does not obligate you to purchase a service or product from a Service Provider or a Service Provider’s Agent, nor does it obligate a Service Provider or Service Provider’s Agent to agree to provide you with any particular product or service about which you may have inquired.</p>
<p>You might not be matched with a Service Provider or Service Provider’s Agent making any specific offer. Additionally, nothing contained herein shall constitute an offer or promise for a specific product or service.  Leadnomics does not guarantee acceptance into any particular program or the specific terms or conditions of any Service Provider or Service Provider’s Agent; approval standards for the products and services offered by our affiliate Servicer Providers and Service Providers’ Agents are established and maintained solely by the individual Service Providers and Service Providers’ Agents. Likewise, Leadnomics does not guarantee that the price, rates, or terms offered and made available by its participating Service Providers and Service Providers’ Agents are the lowest rates available in the market or the best terms available, and not all Service Providers and Service Providers’ Agents in our network offer all products featured on this Website.  Service Providers’ and Service Providers’ Agents’ offers may be subject to market conditions, approval and qualification.

<p>This Agreement shall be treated as though they were executed and performed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (without regard to conflict of law principles). SHOULD A DISPUTE ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND LEADNOMICS (OR, WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES INVOLVING YOUR DATA SUBMITTED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICE, BETWEEN YOU AND ANY PERSON WHO PURCHASES SUCH DATA) CONCERNING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE BREACH OF SAME BY ANY PARTY HERETO, ANY DATA SUBMITTED BY YOU, THE WEBSITE OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY LEADNOMICS, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE FOR RESOLUTION BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, WHO WILL BE EMPOWERED TO AWARD ANY FORM OF INDIVIDUAL RELIEF, INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. IN ORDER TO KEEP HEARING COSTS DOWN, HEARINGS MAY, AT YOUR REQUEST, BE CONDUCTED TELEPHONICALLY OR ENTIRELY UPON SUBMISSIONS. IN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT THAT YOU PREVAIL AT THE HEARING, AND THE AMOUNT AWARDED TO YOU BY THE ARBITRATOR IS GREATER THAN LEADNOMICS’S LAST WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER TO YOU, LEADNOMICS AGREES TO PAY TWICE THE AMOUNT OF YOUR REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS, AND A MINIMUM AWARD OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). HOWEVER, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE LEADNOMICS FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR TRADE SECRET RIGHTS BY BRINGING AN ACTION IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, INCLUDING THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA. YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT BY NOTIFYING LEADNOMICS IN WRITING AT 2637 E. ATLANTIC BLVD #19028, POMPANO BEACH, FL 33062 WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER SUBMITTING YOUR DATA THAT IS INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE.</p>

YOU AGREE TO THE ENTRY OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP SUCH A LAWSUIT OR TO REMOVE YOU AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE SUIT. YOU AGREE TO PAY THE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COURT COSTS THAT LEADNOMICS OR ANY PERSON PURCHASING YOUR DATA INCURS IN SEEKING SUCH RELIEF. THIS PROVISION PREVENTING YOU FROM BRINGING, JOINING OR PARTICIPATING IN CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED, MULTI-DISTRICT, OR COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION LAWSUITS IS AN INDEPENDENT AGREEMENT AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY OF YOUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES TO PURSUE A CLAIM INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION IN BINDING ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED ABOVE. ANY PERSON WHO PURCHASES DATA SUBMITTED BY YOU THROUGH THE WEBSITE SHALL BE DEEMED A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS IN THIS SECTION AND SHALL BE ABLE TO ENFORCE SUCH PROVISIONS DIRECTLY AGAINST YOU. </p>
<p>If any provision contained in this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the original meaning of the severed provision while conforming to applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Should a dispute arise between you and Leadnomics and should the arbitration provisions herein become inapplicable or unenforceable, or in any instance of any lawsuit brought by Leadnomics to enforce its intellectual property or trade secret rights, the parties agree that jurisdiction over and venue of any suit shall be exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and you hereby consent to the exercise of jurisdiction and venue by such courts.

<h5>18. Copyright Infringement</h5>
<p>As Leadnomics asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others, and requires its Users to do so. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any third-party Content on the Website infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C § 512(c)(3) for further detail): (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on or available through our Website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at those locations; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit Leadnomics to locate the material; (iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address; (v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Leadnomics’ designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is <b>Copyright Agent, 2637 E Atlantic Blvd #19028, Pompano Beach, FL 33062</b>. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to Leadnomics’ customer service. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid. In the event that you believe Leadnomics removed any of your Content in response to a false notice of copyright infringement, you should notify Leadnomics promptly in writing pursuant to the DMCA, at the mailing address provided above. Such notification should include: (i) your physical or electronic signature; (ii) identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled; (iii) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and (iv) your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. Furthermore, you should include a clear statement of your acceptance of process pertaining to the notifying party or the agent of the party as defined in DMCA § 512(c)(1)(C). If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Leadnomics may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider or User, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole and absolute discretion. Leadnomics has a policy of terminating the account of, or denying access or use of the Website to, in its sole and absolute discretion, any User who repeatedly infringes the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.</p>
